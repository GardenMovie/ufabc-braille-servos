# Refreshable Braille Cell

A refreshable braille cell and actuator, created with 3D printing and laser cutting. The project was hosted on a cloud drive solution and then put here on github after the end of the course.

This group project was developed as part of a university course on Solutions for Engineering Challenges at Universidade Federal do ABC (UFABC), focusing on acessibility, fast prototyping using 3D printing and laser cutting, iterative design and an Arduino board for logic.

Inspired by [Braille Systems's braille display](https://github.com/braille-systems/braille-display). Some pieces were taken directly from their files, those made by the group are available on this repo.
